GRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greece is a nation on the precipice of turmoil. In parliament, the powerful political machines of the left-center-right trichotomy have only strengthened their grip on the already toxic Greek political scene. Meanwhile, King Paul I has continued the monarchical tradition of interference and meddling in politics, a family pastime likely to be continued by Crown Prince Constantine. Against this background, lesser military officers- Captains, Majors, and Colonels- plot to save their beloved Greece from its own creation- democracy.  As Greece teeters towards chaos, its leaders have several choices before them; democracy or autocracy, communism or capitalism, monarchy or republic."
