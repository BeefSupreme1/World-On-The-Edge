  wotedenmark.1.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.1.d:0 "This morning Mona Rasmussen, just 7 years old, biked alone to her schoolbus which were to arrive at half past eleven. But as the clock turned 11:30, Mona was nowhere to be seen. Three of her classmates noticed her bike in the bushes on their way home from school, two of them ran home to their fathers to tell them the news, and soon the whole neighborhood was looking for Mona. Now three hours have passed, Mona's mother has been crying since the beginning. And with little left to comfort her with, they decided to call the cops." 
  wotedenmark.1.a:0 "You sure the cops are necessary?"
  wotedenmark.2.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.2.d:0 "When the cops arrived their luck werent much better than the neighborhoods, they thoroughly searched both the nearby area and the area surrounding Hvidkilde lake. The cops have now returned to their station, but Mona still hasnt been found, and as such they now request the mayors allowence to expand the operation."
  wotedenmark.2.a:0 "Keep the investigation small"
  wotedenmark.2.b:0 "Send every cop available!"
  wotedenmark.3.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.3.d:0 "The cops came back the day after, but again their luck was none. A few more times during the month a squad of cops quickly would sweep the area, but to no avail. The Mona case has been left open for future at-home detectives to wonder over, and what really happened to that poor girl may never be known."
  wotedenmark.3.a:0 "Maybe she'll turn up eventually?"
  wotedenmark.4.t:0 "The Mona case"
  wotedenmark.4.d:0 "Mona's corpse found in Nørresø! A total of 900 policemen and women has been searching the area around Mona's bicycle for around a month now, with assistance of both helicopters and police dogs but none of this turned out to be enough... However all the news about the event alongside the helicopters circling the airspace above his home made Søren, a local cyclist, look a little closer on his way to work. And he did see something suspicios; a bindle in the middle of lake Nørresø, in that bindle was Monas body sawed in two and a further post-mortem analysis of her body showed that she had been raped then later strangled... This is truly gonna haunt this nation for years..."
  wotedenmark.4.a:0 "Who would do something so horrible!"
  wotedenmark_tt: "This decision will most likely have an effect on the upcoming election.       "
  wotedenmark.5.t:0 "Conservatives speak out against inaction of government"
  wotedenmark.5.d:0 "In an campaign speech earlier today, the conservative party condemned the government for inaction towards the disappearance of Mona Rasmussen. Stating that if they were to be placed in government, they would commit 'hundreds of officers' to find the girl, and make their number one priority be the safety of this nations children. We need to reestablish 'law and order' they added."
  wotedenmark.5.a:0 "Dont worry, she'll turn up any day now"
  wotedenmark.6.t:0 "Conservatives speak out against lack of law and order"
  wotedenmark.6.d:0 "'This terrible horrible tragedy, would not have happened if upholding the law was in any way a socialist priority!' those were the harsh words coming from the leader of 'Det konservative folkeparti', he continued by adding that it would be a top priority of the conservatives to 'secure the safety of this nations children'."
  wotedenmark.6.a:0 "Using this tragedy for political gain? Shameful!"
  wotedenmark.7.t:0 "The Mona case; perpetrator found!"
  wotedenmark.7.d:0 "The bindle used to store Mona Rasumessens body was made in 27,000 examples, 90 of which were sold to a local store, 10 of which were sold to a local man; 38-year old purser, father of four. The man was previously charged with sexual crimes, so it didn't take long for the police to make him prime suspect. However the man refused the crime, so the police needed definate proof. And that proof came a few days later when a piece of cloth, still drenched in an intoxicating fluid, was found near Nørresø lake, the police then found a matching piece of cloth in the house of the perpetrator and no more evidence was needed."
  wotedenmark.7.a:0 "Rot in jail bastard!"
  wotedenmark2_tt: "The mona case is now settled.       "
